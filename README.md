# Rock_paper
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game for two players. Each player chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Players reveal their choices simultaneously, and the winner is decided based on the rules. If both choose the same option, it's a tie.
